OCR correction in browser for Leiden Hackathon
==============================================

Web interface for correcting OCR text from BHL. Goal is to provide a simple interface for interactive editing of text, as well as tools to make inferences from the edits (e.g., frequency of certain kinds of OCR errors).

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dshorthouse/ocr-correction.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/dshorthouse/ocr-correction)

## Requirements & Dependencies

This code requires [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org), PHP 5.6+, and a local web server such as Apache with mod\_rewrite enabled. Install all necessary dependencies using [composer](https://getcomposer.org) and update them as required from the ocr-correction source directory.

    $ composer install
    $ composer update

## Configuration

Rename /config/config.php.sample to /config/config.php and adjust as necessary

Example Apache VirtualHost
--------------------------

    <VirtualHost *:80>
      ServerName www.ocr-correction.local
      ServerAlias ocr-correction.local
      DocumentRoot /Users/dshorthouse/Sites/ocr-correction
      <Directory "/Users/dshorthouse/Sites/ocr-correction">
        Options -Indexes +FollowSymlinks
        AllowOverride None
        Require all granted
        DirectoryIndex index.php
        RewriteEngine on
        RewriteBase /
        RewriteRule ^(public|sitemap.xml|robots.txt)($|/) - [L]
        RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
        RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
        RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?q=$1 [L,QSA]
      </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>

If you use something like www.ocr-correction.local for the ServerName, don't forget to adjust your /etc/hosts file.

### Create database and views

Use the included, self-executable command-line utility to create the database and two necessary views:

  ./bin/initialize.php --create

## Page images and DjVu XML files

You can fetch page images and DjVu XML from BioStor.

[http://biostor.org/bhl_page_xml.php?PageID=34570741](http://biostor.org/bhl_page_xml.php?PageID=34570741)

[http://biostor.org/bhl_page_bw_image.php?PageID=34570741](http://biostor.org/bhl_page_bw_image.php?PageID=34570741)

## Running in the Browser

Assuming your application is running via www.ocr-correction.local, you can access the included /public/examples by appending the PageId as part of the path:

http://www.ocr-correction.local/16002437

## Tests

PHPUnit is used for unit tests and [Selenium](http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.53/) and Facebook's [php-webdriver](https://github.com/facebook/php-webdriver) are used for integration tests. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is used to include dependencies.

    $ java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.53.1.jar
    $ ./vendor/bin/phpunit -c Tests/firefox.phpunit.xml

If you wish to use Chrome instead of FireFox, the Selenium Chromedriver can be found at [http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html](http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html):

    $ java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.53.1.jar -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=/usr/local/bin/chromedriver
    $ ./vendor/bin/phpunit -c Tests/chrome.phpunit.xml

Likewise, if you wish to use a headless webdriver such as [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/):

    $ java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.53.1 -Dphantomjs.binary.path=/usr/local/bin/phantomjs
    $ ./vendor/bin/phpunit -c Tests/phantomjs.phpunit.xml

Tests are split into suites entitled, "Unit", "Functional"

    $ ./vendor/bin/phpunit -c Tests/chrome.phpunit.xml --testsuite "Unit"
